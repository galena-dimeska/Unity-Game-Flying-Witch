# Unity Game - Flying Witch

The game, titled "Flying Witch", is a Halloween-themed desktop riff on the popular mobile game Flappy Bird. The user plays as a witch character that flies while trying to avoid touching zombie hands that spawn from the ground and sky.  

The game features a main menu where the player can choose to go to the "How to Play" scene to see the instructions of the game, or if they are ready, they can choose the option to select a character and play.

There are 3 types of witch character skins that the player can choose to play as, based on personal preference, to enhance the visual experience of the game.

After selecting the character and clicking on the "Play" button the player will be taken to the main scene of the game.
When the player presses on the round play button, there is a 3 second countdown after which the game officially starts. The witch character is made to continuously fall downwards and the player must click anywhere on the screen to make her go upwards in order to avoid the zombie hand obstacles, which are continuously generated and move from right to left, thereby simulating the flying and moving of the witch even though she is just moving up and down.

The score increases by 1 every time the player passes one set of zombie hands and the game ends then the player touches one of the zombie hands, after which they have the option to replay the game or close the game window and exit the game. Additionally, the game keeps track of the high score on the device.
